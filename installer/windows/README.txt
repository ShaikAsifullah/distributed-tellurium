This directory does not have, on github, hardly anything you need to get it to run.  You'll need to add and unzip the following files:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytellurium/files/dependencies/libRoadrunner-installer-dependencies.zip/download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytellurium/files/dependencies/spyder_dependencies.zip/download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytellurium/files/dependencies/super_installer_dependencies.zip/download

Then go into the super_installer_dependencies/ directory and unzip all of *those* files, too.

If you have to update any of the files therein, zip up the directories again and upload them back again.


The particular files in those zip files come from:
